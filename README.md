## Abstract

Previous research has been done in analyzing
the affective orientation of song lyrics, however,
not in Japanese. Here an affect analysis
package for Japanese was used to identify
affective states in a corpus of Japanese
rock music. Lyrics were given an affective
score to quantitatively measure the prevalence
of affective states which was then compared
across the time span of the corpus. An increasing
use of negatively oriented affective expressions
was found. Challenges when working
with Japanese text, as well as linguistically
unique characteristics when expressing emotions
in Japanese were also identified, to encourage
further research and improvement in
this area.
